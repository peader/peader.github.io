First you'll need a loggly account. If you don't already have one you can sign up for their free tier [here](https://www.loggly.com/signup/).

Once you're signed up you'll need to head over to "Source Setup" > "Customer Tokens" and copy the customer token from the list. We'll use this a little bit later.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
